# 🏭 IIoT Predictive Maintenance & Asset Reliability Console

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates an End-to-End Industrial IoT (IIoT) pipeline designed to predict engine failures before they occur. Using a dataset of over 100,000 sensor readings, I built a system that ingests raw telemetry data, processes it for degradation signals, and visualizes actionable insights for maintenance teams.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python (Pandas/Matplotlib):** Rolling mean signal smoothing, "Knee Point" detection algorithms, and anomaly classification.
* **SQL (BigQuery):** Calculated Remaining Useful Life (RUL) at the database level for scalability.
* **Tableau:** Interactive "Fleet Health" dashboard for visualizing thermal and vibration anomalies.

## 📊 Key Results
* **Early Detection:** Identified mechanical degradation signals (Thermal/Vibration) prior to failure.
* **Scalability:** Engineered a reusable pipeline for processing raw sensor streams.
* **Operational Value:** Created a "Command Center" view to prioritize maintenance work orders.

## 📂 File Structure
* **`Reliability Command Center`**
  * *Description:* A screenshot of the final "Reliability Command Center" dashboard. It visualizes the real-time thermal trend analysis (top) and the fleet health status (bottom), highlighting critical assets in red.

* **`Data_Clean_txt_to_CSV_py.ipynb`**
  * *Description:* Jupyter Notebook that handles raw data ingestion. It reads the unstructured text telemetry, fixes whitespace separators using regex, and enforces the correct schema headers.
  
* **`Rul_data.sql`**
  * *Description:* The SQL logic used to calculate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for each engine. It uses Window Functions to determine the maximum life cycle and flags assets as "Critical" or "Warning" based on thresholds.

* **`maintenance_analysis_py.ipynb`**
  * *Description:* The core Python analysis script. It performs signal smoothing, calculates Z-Scores to detect outliers, and classifies sensors into "Thermal" vs "Vibration" categories for the dashboard.

* **`final_dashboard_data.csv`**
  * *Description:* The clean, processed output file generated by the pipeline. This is the direct data source used to power the Tableau visualizations.
